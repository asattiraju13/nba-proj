# NBA Draft Visualization App

### Description

The goal of this app is to generate various plots based on user choices of different variables to analyze from statistics scraped off of Basketball Reference for the top 10 picks of each NBA draft from 2001 - 2020. I wanted to create this app to delve into full-stack development and get hands-on experience using the MERN stack.

Backend: Express, Node, MongoDB

Data Acquisition: Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup

### Progress

- [x] Get data into MongoDB database
